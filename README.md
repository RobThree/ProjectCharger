*Testing and comparing 21 cheap USB chargers*

## Description

I ordered 21 (ultra) cheap USB chargers from AliExpress and will test them to see if they:

* can provide the power they claim to be able to deliver
* are safe to use (will they catch on fire üî• or even explode üí•)?
* aren't just overpriced fire hazards (provide bang-for-buck üí∂üíµ)

## Status

**2025-03-06**: The project was started today and will take some time to complete. Currently the project is in the setup phase so this project is still üöß under construction üöß. I have ordered and received ~~12~~ 21 chargers and have taken some üì∑ [pictures](https://github.com/RobThree/ProjectCharger/tree/main/images). Basic data has been entered in a üìù [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MLatioRcDbH1atz-dB_jMyGtM_djYzLRvWk6to6tpT4/edit?usp=sharing) (which will also be used to record measurements etc. during this project) for the first 12 chargers.

**2025-03-15**: All chargers have been received, all basic data has been entered into the üìù [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MLatioRcDbH1atz-dB_jMyGtM_djYzLRvWk6to6tpT4/edit?usp=sharing). A test-protocol, to ensure all chargers undergo the same tests under the same conditions, has been written and is nearly finished. A [viewer to visualize the test results](/measurements/?data=example) has been created. Software to run the tests automated on the DL24-P has been written. After a few finishing touches, testing will commence sometime soon in the upcoming days üéâ üöÄ

<sup>* Ordered in US version by (my) mistake. Other than the plug standard / format there shouldn't be any difference. These chargers will be tested with a simple adapter plug.</sup>

As a 'control' group (to prove the USB cables are good, the USB tester detects all protocols etc.) we have the following "expensive" or "brand" chargers:

1. [UGREEN Nexode 100W USB C GaN Charger CD226](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005002529458406.html) (‚Ç¨54.99 / $59.55)
