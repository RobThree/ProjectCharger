*Testing and comparing 12 cheap USB chargers*

## Description

I have ordered 12 (ultra) cheap USB chargers from AliExpress. I will be testing these to see if they:

* can provide the power they claim to be able to deliver
* are safe to use (will they catch on fire 🔥 or even explode 💥)?
* aren't just overpriced fire hazards (provide bang-for-buck 💶💵)

## Status

This project was started on 2025-03-06 and will take some time to complete. Currently I am still in the setup phase. I have ordered and received 12 chargers and have taken some 📷 [pictures](https://github.com/RobThree/ProjectCharger/tree/main/images). Basic data has been entered in a 📝 [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MLatioRcDbH1atz-dB_jMyGtM_djYzLRvWk6to6tpT4/edit?usp=sharing) which will also be used to record measurements etc. during this project.

<sup>* Ordered in US version by (my) mistake. Other than the plug standard / format there shouldn't be any difference. These chargers will be tested with a simple adapter plug.</sup>

## Test protocol

The test protocol is currently being determined but will include:

* 🔌 Measuring draw from outlet
* 📱 Determining supported USB protocols
* 📐 Measuring output in several combinations, setups and durations, each test producing:
    * ⚡ Measurements (Voltage, current, temperature, ...) at:
        * No load
        * 75% load
        * Rated load
        * Overload (10%, 25%, ...)
    * ⚖️ Weight
    * 🌡️ Infrared image
    * 📉 Voltage / current graphs
    * 📈 Ripple
* Teardown pictures

Measurements will be done using an [Atorch DL24-P](http://en.atorch.cn/ProDetail.aspx?ProID=13), [FNIRSI FNB58](https://www.fnirsi.com/products/fnb58), [Geti PM001](https://www.geti.eu/en/products/energy/power-consumption-meters/digital-energy-meter-geti-pm001), [Kaiweets KTI-W01](https://kaiweets.com/products/kti-w01-handheld-thermal-camera), [Hanmatek DOS1102](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000768225718.html) and [OWON XDM1241](https://www.owon.com.hk/products_owon_4_1%7C2_digits_xdm1000_series_bench-type_digital_multimeter). Not the most expensive or best test equipment, but will do fine for this project.
