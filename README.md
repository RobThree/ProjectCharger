*Testing and comparing 21 cheap USB chargers*

## Description

I ordered 21 (ultra) cheap USB chargers from AliExpress and will test them to see if they:

* can provide the power they claim to be able to deliver
* are safe to use (will they catch on fire üî• or even explode üí•)?
* aren't just overpriced fire hazards (provide bang-for-buck üí∂üíµ)

## Status

This project was started on 2025-03-06 and will take some time to complete. Currently the project is in the setup phase so this project is still üöß under construction üöß. I have ordered and received 21 chargers and have taken some üì∑ [pictures](https://github.com/RobThree/ProjectCharger/tree/main/images). Basic data has been entered in a üìù [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MLatioRcDbH1atz-dB_jMyGtM_djYzLRvWk6to6tpT4/edit?usp=sharing) which will also be used to record measurements etc. during this project.

<sup>* Ordered in US version by (my) mistake. Other than the plug standard / format there shouldn't be any difference. These chargers will be tested with a simple adapter plug.<br>
** Name / model to be confirmed upon delivery</sup>

As a 'control' group (to prove the USB cables are good, the USB tester detects all protocols etc.) we have the following "expensive" or "brand" chargers:

1. [UGREEN Nexode 100W USB C GaN Charger CD226](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005002529458406.html) (‚Ç¨54.99 / $59.55)
2. [UGREEN Nexode 200W USB C GaN Charger CD271](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005008473171077.html) (‚Ç¨117.39 / $127.11)
3. [Xiaomi Power Bank 3 Pro PLM07ZM](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005007232373605.html) (‚Ç¨45.39 / $49.15)
4. [Shenzhen GOOD-SHE Technology Co., Ltd. GS-W65A0927](http://www.good-she.com/web/index.php/product/index/g/e/id/278.html) (‚Ç¨25.00 / $27.07)

## Test protocol

The test protocol is currently being determined but will include:

* üîå Measuring current draw from outlet
* üì± Determining supported USB protocols
* üìê Measuring output in several combinations, setups and durations, each test producing:
    * ‚ö° Measurements (Voltage, current, temperature, ...) at:
        * No load
        * 75% load
        * Rated load
        * Overload (10%, 25%, ...)
    * ‚öñÔ∏è Weight
    * üå°Ô∏è Infrared image
    * üìâ Voltage / current graphs
    * üìà Ripple
* Teardown pictures

Measurements will be done using an [Atorch DL24-P](http://en.atorch.cn/ProDetail.aspx?ProID=13), [FNIRSI FNB58](https://www.fnirsi.com/products/fnb58), [Geti PM001](https://www.geti.eu/en/products/energy/power-consumption-meters/digital-energy-meter-geti-pm001), [Kaiweets KTI-W01](https://kaiweets.com/products/kti-w01-handheld-thermal-camera), [Hanmatek DOS1102](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000768225718.html), [OWON XDM1241](https://www.owon.com.hk/products_owon_4_1%7C2_digits_xdm1000_series_bench-type_digital_multimeter) and [Imtex precision scale](https://www.bol.com/nl/nl/p/imtex-precisie-digitale-weegschaal-500-gram-x-001-gram/9300000074911968/). Not the most expensive or best test equipment, but will do fine for this project.
